# Backend for Project 4

Project 4 is a web application that hosts songs and playlists. I used Ruby on Rails to create the backend api. 

I created a many to many relationship between songs and playlists: songs can belong to many playlists, and a playlist can have many songs.

The api is deployed on heroku: https://rails-songs-playlists-api.herokuapp.com/songs
